# Invariant Measures in Delay-Coordinates

This repository contains python code which can be used to reproduce the numerical experiments in our work *Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Idenfitification.* 

`torus_rotation.py`: This file simulates trajectories of four different torus rotation maps and visualizes the corresponding state-coordinate invariant measures and delay-coordinate invariant measures.

`NN_measure_loss.py`: This file trains a neural network to learn the dynamics of the Lorenz-63 system using loss functions based on either the state-coordinate or delay-coordinate invariant meausre.

`plot_training_result.py`: This file plots the result of the neural network training.
